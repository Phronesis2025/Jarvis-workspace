# MVP Lane Evidence Log (Phase 2)

**Prompt #:** 20  
**Phase #:** 2  
**Tranche #:** 3

## Purpose

This document is an operator-facing place to record lane-level evidence against the **Phase 2 MVP approval gate** standard.

This log does **NOT** grant approval and does **NOT** change `approved` in `mvp_lane_approval.json`.

## Approval authority (binding)

The only binding approval gate is:

`future_modules/the_fade/config/mvp_lane_approval.json`

Until that file is updated to `approved: true`, **no MVP lanes are approved**.

## Evidence-tracking authority

Use this registry to track evidence completeness across lanes:

`future_modules/the_fade/config/mvp_lane_evidence_registry.json`

## Candidate lanes under deferred review (same four lanes as the Phase 2 gate)

- `lane_a_public_signal`
- `lane_b_official_disclosure`
- `lane_c_market_context`
- `lane_e_research_swarm_context` (context-only evidence; must not override primary lane truth)

## Evidence dimensions (exact list)

For each lane, collect evidence for these dimensions:

- `reliability`
- `freshness`
- `normalization_viability`
- `stale_outage_behavior`
- `conflict_handling`
- `context_dominance_risk`

## Review format (record evidence per lane)

Use this format per lane. Fill the fields with operator observations; if something is unknown, write `unknown` and keep it explicit.

## Status (current)

This log is created for evidence collection. As of creation, evidence is expected to be recorded by the operator before any MVP approval change.
